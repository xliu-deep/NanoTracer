Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), with magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) as the most abundant species, are ubiquitously present in the natural environment. MNPs are also among the most applied engineered nanoparticles and can be produced incidentally by various human activities. Identification of the sources of MNPs is crucial for their risk assessment and regulation, which however is still an unsolved problem. Here we report a novel approach, hierarchical machine learning-aided iron (Fe)-oxygen (O) isotopic fingerprinting, to address this problem. We found that naturally occurring, incidental, and engineered MNPs have distinct Fe-O isotopic fingerprints probably due to significant Fe/O isotope fractionation during their generation processes, which enables to establish a Fe-O isotopic library covering different sources. Furthermore, we developed a three-level machine learning model that not only is capable of distinguishing the sources of MNPs but also can identify the species (Fe3O4 or γ-Fe2O3) and synthetic routes of engineered MNPs with a high discrimination precision of 81.6%. The source traceability was verified with real samples such as soil and magnetite ores. This work represents the first feasible strategy for source recognition of iron oxide nanoparticles, and also shows the power of hierarchical machine learning in solving complex environmental issues.
